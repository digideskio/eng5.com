<h1><span>Synco</span> CRM &amp; Billing System</h1>
<p>
<img src="/images/display_synco.png" class="alignright" alt="Backstage" style="margin-top:-20px;" />
Synco is our internal customer resource management and billing system. Built using Ruby on Rails, Synco and its client-facing counterpart 
<a href="projects/backstage.html">Backstage</a> are used by every staff member and client. From the order process to provisioning of orders to 
cancellations, Synco handles it all! 
</p>
<p>
First released in February 2006, Synco has seen many changes and improvements over the years. Though it has served Site5 extremely well, 
the decision was made to begin a complete rewrite from the ground up. Many of the underlying technologies have evolved since Synco's 
creation, and after much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that a complete rewrite was the best solution.
</p>
<p>
Expected v1 release of Synco 2.0 is slated for December 2011/January 2012.
