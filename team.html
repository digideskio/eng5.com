      <h2>Josh Priddle</h2>
      <span class="title">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>
			<p>Josh started designing web sites as a hobby when he was 12. Soon after, he started focusing on backend development with PHP and MySQL. He fell in love with Ruby and the open source community while working for a local Voice Over IP company. He currently specializes in Rails and iPhone application development with Ruby and Javascript, but never passes up the opportunity to try something new.</p>
			<p>Josh is passionate about software development and open source, so a lot of his free time is spent working on new or existing open source projects, or learning new technologies. He enjoys playing with Linux and the command line just for the fun of it. When he's away from the terminal, he likes listening to music, reading, gaming, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

      <h2>Tom Sepper</h2>
      <span class="title">CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER</span>
			<p>Tom is a pseudo-member of the Site5 Engineering Team. He knows PHP fairly well and knows just enough Ruby on Rails to make <a href="#jmazzi">Justin Mazzi</a> have a heart attack. He maintains the bulk of the corporate webpages and contributes minor portions to other projects such as Synco/Backstage, SiteAdmin, and the helpdesk. When not thinking he's an engineering apprentice, Tom is Site5's Chief Operating Officer and spends his time <em>operating</em>.</p>
			<p>Outside of work, Tom enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters and does photography on the side. He's also an avid Apple fan.. okay, a borderline fanboy. But that's alright.</p>
