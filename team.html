      <h2>Josh Priddle</h2>
      <span class="title">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>
			<p>Josh started designing web sites as a hobby when he was 12. Soon after, he started focusing on backend development with PHP and MySQL. He fell in love with Ruby and the open source community while working for a local Voice Over IP company. He currently specializes in Rails and iPhone application development with Ruby and Javascript, but never passes up the opportunity to try something new.</p>
			<p>Josh is passionate about software development and open source, so a lot of his free time is spent working on new or existing open source projects, or learning new technologies. He enjoys playing with Linux and the command line just for the fun of it. When he's away from the terminal, he likes listening to music, reading, gaming, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
