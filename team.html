      <h2>Josh Priddle</h2>
      <span class="title">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>
			<p>Josh started designing web sites as a hobby when he was 12. Soon after, he started focusing on backend development with PHP and MySQL. He fell in love with Ruby and the open source community while working for a local Voice Over IP company. He currently specializes in Rails and iPhone application development with Ruby and Javascript, but never passes up the opportunity to try something new.</p>
			<p>Josh is passionate about software development and open source, so a lot of his free time is spent working on new or existing open source projects, or learning new technologies. He enjoys playing with Linux and the command line just for the fun of it. When he's away from the terminal, he likes listening to music, reading, gaming, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

      <h2>Floyd Wright</h2>
      <span class="title">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>

			<p>Floyd started putting together simple web lean-tos and herding little javascripts as a teenager.  Like many, he got his first two bars (PHP/mySQL) in college building back end tools for everything from managing class rosters to collaborative studying.  Eventually he discovered Ruby by way of the artist formerly known as Why the Lucky Stiff's modest pamphlet, and he immediately took flight on the Principle of Least Surprise.</p>			
			<p>He is also trained in philosophy (PhD is in progress) and takes a very theoretical approach to coding that, like all philosophy, tends to drive pragmatists up the wall.  This is his main hobby, but if you twist his arm he will let you take him snowboarding, sailing, or camping or really anywhere under an open sky where he can enjoy a glass of scotch or fine craft beer and a camp steak and forget for a moment that You're Doing It Wrong.</p>

      <h2>Fabio Kreusch</h2>
      <span class="title">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>

			<p>Fabio was always interested in computers, and that eventually lead him to study Information Systems at a
university. After working on developing systems and websites with Java, PHP and Javascript for a while, he discovered Ruby, the Rails
framework and it's wonderful open source community.</p>			
			<p>In his free time he likes to read random stuff, watch documentaries, play video games or just learn about
another new programming library.</p>

      <span class="title">PRESIDENT &amp; CO-OWNER</span>
			<p>Joel started working in the industry as a web designer and slowly moved into web development and programming. He spends most of his time working with PHP and MySQL. Joel has been instrumental in the development of our helpdesk as well as our landing page system and other internal applications.</p>			
			<p>When not working, Joel loves playing Ultimate Frisbee and likes skiing, hiking, climbing, kayaking -- pretty much anything in the mountains. He also loves learning science and philosophy and is particularly fascinated by neuroscience.</p>

      <h2>Tom Sepper</h2>
      <span class="title">CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER</span>
			<p>Tom is a pseudo-member of the Site5 Engineering Team. He knows PHP fairly well and knows just enough Ruby on Rails to make <a href="#jmazzi">Justin Mazzi</a> have a heart attack. He maintains the bulk of the corporate webpages and contributes minor portions to other projects such as Synco/Backstage, SiteAdmin, and the helpdesk. When not thinking he's an engineering apprentice, Tom is Site5's Chief Operating Officer and spends his time <em>operating</em>.</p>
			<p>Outside of work, Tom enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters and does photography on the side. He's also an avid Apple fan.. okay, a borderline fanboy. But that's alright.</p>
