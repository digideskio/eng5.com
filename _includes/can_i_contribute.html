<h2>Can I Contribute?</h2>
<p>Yes! We're big believers in open source! We ask that you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fork the project.</li>
	<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.</li>
	<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.</li>
	<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)</li>
	<li>Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.</li>
</ul>
